# Portfolio

nickmusey.com

A personal portfolio site built using React. The code isn't my best work but I haven't had a chance to completely start fresh yet. It automatically pulls any public Github repos of mine and displays them.

## Changing the information
First clone the project and open it in an editor. The most common thing to change is the skills and currently learning section, which are mapped from arrays near the top of `components/homepage/homepage.jsx`.

Content all lives in the same `homepage` component, the rest of the components are brought in from there and shouldn't need to be changed unless there's a bug.

## Deployment
After committing changes, the site can be deployed by following the instructions found [here](https://github.com/nmusey/nmusey.github.io#deploying).
